Switch to extensible exceptions so GHC shuts up

Add support for multiple networks
    Or just run one bot per network, hehehe.

Add support for CTCP messages
    The Seen stuff now prints ACTIONs nicely.
    Anything else will probably have to be handled on a per-message basis,
    as CTCP messages are just like any other but with some \SOH thrown in.
